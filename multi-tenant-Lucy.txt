This code sets up a basic multi-tenant API with different access tiers.
1. Project Structure
For a clean setup, your project could be organized as follows:
lucian_saas/
├── Dockerfile
├── main.py
├── models.py
└── requirements.txt

2. File Contents
Here is the code for each file.
requirements.txt
This file lists the necessary Python packages.
# requirements.txt
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]

models.py
This file defines the data structures for your application, such as users and subscription tiers, which are central to the multi-tenant architecture.
# models.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from enum import Enum
from typing import Optional, List
import uuid

# Define the paid tiers from the blueprint
class SubscriptionTier(str, Enum):
   free = "Free"
   pro = "Pro"
   syndicate = "Syndicate"

class User(BaseModel):
   id: str = Field(default_factory=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4()))
   username: str
   tier: SubscriptionTier = SubscriptionTier.free
   syndicate_id: Optional[str] = None

class Signal(BaseModel):
   sport: str
   event: str
   market: str
   prediction: str
   confidence: float
   status: str # e.g., "PENDING", "ACTIVE", "SETTLED"

class Wallet(BaseModel):
   user_id: str
   provider: str # e.g., "MetaMask", "Phantom"
   address: str
   is_connected: bool = True


main.py
This is the main application file. It uses FastAPI to create the REST endpoints and includes placeholder logic for the different tiers.
# main.py

Dockerfile
This file allows you to containerize the application for modular deployment, as specified in the tech stack.
# Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container at /app
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application's code into the container at /app
COPY . .

# Expose port 8000 to the outside world
EXPOSE 8000

# Command to run the application using uvicorn
# This will start the FastAPI server
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

3. How to Run This Code
1. Save the files in a directory named lucian_saas/ as shown in the structure above.
2. Install Docker on your machine if you haven't already.
3. Open your terminal, navigate into the lucian_saas/ directory.
4. Build the Docker image by running the following command:
docker build -t lucian-saas .

5. Run the Docker container:
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name lucian-api lucian-saas

6. Access the API: Your SaaS backend is now running. You can access the interactive documentation by opening your web browser to http://localhost:8000/docs. From there, you can test the endpoints directly.
