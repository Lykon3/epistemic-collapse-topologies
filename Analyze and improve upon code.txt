Here is an analysis and improvement of the Python code for the Lucian Betting Engine v2.0.
Overall Analysis
[cite_start]The provided script is a solid step forward, successfully bridging the gap between theoretical models and live market data. [cite_start]The architecture correctly isolates the API communication into its own class (APIManager) [cite_start]and establishes a base BettingModel class for future expansion. [cite_start]The main execution block logically fetches data and passes it to the models.
However, the code can be improved in four key areas: Security, Object-Oriented Design, Configuration Management, and Modularity.
Proposed Improvements and Refactored Code
Here are specific, actionable improvements with a rewritten code block.
1. Security: Secure the API Key
[cite_start]Hardcoding sensitive information like an API key directly in the script is a security risk. The best practice is to load it from the environment, which keeps your credentials separate from the source code.
2. Object-Oriented Design: Make Models Truly Independent
[cite_start]The original BettingModel base class contains a specific implementation for analyze_market_data. This forces every model to perform the exact same analysis. A better design is to have the base class define the interface (the methods a model must have) and have each subclass provide its own unique logic.
This is changed by:
* Making the base analyze_market_data method raise a NotImplementedError, forcing subclasses to implement it.
* Creating proper subclasses for each model (MatthewModel, SharpRecoilModel, etc.) that inherit from BettingModel.
* Providing a unique (though still illustrative) analysis method for each model.
3. Configuration Management: Centralize Settings
[cite_start]While placing configuration variables at the top is good, using a dedicated dictionary or class for configuration makes the code cleaner and easier to manage as more settings are added.
4. Modularity: Parse Data More Cleanly
[cite_start]The nested loops for parsing the API response can become hard to read. We can introduce a simple data parsing function to structure the raw JSON into a more usable list of objects, which simplifies the analysis logic within each model.

Summary of Improvements
* Security: The API_KEY is no longer in the code. It's loaded from the environment, making the script safe to share.
* True Independence: The BettingModel is now a true abstract base class. [cite_start]This enforces a clean design where each specific model (MatthewModel, SharpRecoilModel) is responsible for its own logic, as intended by the original architecture.
* Clarity: The parse_api_data function separates the messy task of parsing the API's JSON from the clean logic of analysis. This makes the analyze methods in the models much easier to read and maintain.
* Scalability: This new structure is far more scalable. [cite_start]Adding a new model (like LucianApexModel or GamblerModel) is now as simple as creating a new class that inherits from BettingModel and implementing its unique analyze method, without touching any other part of the code.
[cite_start]This refactored code is a robust foundation for the next logical step you identified: running the $10K → $1M simulation with the Gambler's Model.
