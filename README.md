Why an Electrician Is Writing About Epistemic Sovereignty

I fix things that hum under voltage. Systems that carry current, fail under stress, demand groundedness—literal and otherwise. So when the world started feeling like it was shorting out epistemically—truth flickering, institutions sizzling, ideological circuits overloaded—I didn’t reach for a philosophy textbook. I reached for a continuity tester.

This repository is born from that instinct: to trace the fault lines in how we know what we know, to diagram the silent loads of ideological infrastructure, to ask why “truth” has become a contested voltage rather than a common current.

I’m a union electrician, not a professor. I don’t claim credentials—I claim tools: recursive modeling, entropy mapping, collapse dynamics, pattern recognition. Things you pick up when you care more about coherence across domains than social permission to explore them.

Epistemic sovereignty, rationalist brittleness, narrative weaponization—these aren’t just academic abstractions. They show up in the algorithms that shape belief, in the pseudo-intellectual grifts that flood YouTube, in the quiet despair of people trying to make sense of conflicting truths. And they’re not going away.

This project isn’t an answer. It’s a diagnostic scaffold. It’s what happens when someone who works with currents by day starts modeling ideological disintegration by night. You’ll find notes, simulations, conceptual frames—tools for others who might want to wire something better out of the noise.

If you’re here, welcome. The grid’s flickering, but maybe we can keep a light on.

A conceptual framework and modeling toolkit for mapping epistemic collapse, rationalist brittleness, narrative weaponization, and the emergence of post-coherence knowledge systems.

“A field manual for navigating the disintegration of epistemic consensus in the information age. Part synthesis, part cartography, this project explores collapse dynamics at the intersection of rationalism, sovereignty, narrative warfare, and knowledge infrastructure—built by a tradesman navigating the arc weld of ideology and entropy.”
