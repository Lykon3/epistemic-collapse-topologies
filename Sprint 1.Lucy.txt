Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2): Foundational Backend & DevOps
The goal of this sprint is to build the core, secure, and scalable infrastructure for your SaaS platform. This sprint focuses on the non-negotiable technical backbone.
1. Set Up Production Environment & Deployment:
* Action: Use the docker-compose.yml file you designed as your starting point.
* Details:
   * Create a project on a cloud provider (like DigitalOcean, Linode, or AWS).
   * Set up a PostgreSQL database and a Redis instance as defined in your docker-compose.yml.
   * Containerize your FastAPI application using the Dockerfile you've already written.
   * Ensure your environment variables (DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, etc.) are securely managed (e.g., using .env files or a cloud provider's secret manager).
2. Implement User Authentication & Subscription Management:
* Action: Integrate a payment processing system like Stripe and build the logic for user sign-up, login, and tier management.
* Details:
   * Create API endpoints in main.py for user registration (/users/) and authentication (e.g., using JWT tokens).
   * Use Stripe's API to handle subscriptions. When a user subscribes, their user model in your database should be updated to reflect their new tier (Pro or Syndicate).
   * The User Pydantic model you created already includes the tier and syndicate_id fields, which is perfect for this.
3. Develop the Core Data Model:
* Action: Solidify your database schemas based on your Pydantic models.
* Details:
   * Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) like SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM to map your Pydantic User, Signal, and Wallet models to your PostgreSQL database tables. This will make interacting with the database in your FastAPI app much cleaner.
Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4): MVP Application & Go-to-Market
The goal of this sprint is to build the minimum viable product that can be launched to your first beta users. This focuses on delivering the core value proposition.
1. Build the MVP Feature Set:
* Action: Implement the API endpoints that deliver the "Free" and "Pro" tier signals.
* Details:
   * The /signals/{user_id} endpoint you designed is the perfect place for this logic.
   * Free Tier: For users with tier == SubscriptionTier.free, return signals with a 24-hour delay. You can achieve this by storing signals with timestamps and only showing them if now() - signal_timestamp > 24 hours.
   * Pro Tier: For users with tier == SubscriptionTier.pro, return signals in real-time. This is your core $49/month feature. The signals should be generated by your trained XGBoost model (from Lucian v4.0), which demonstrated a 55.95% win rate.
2. Create the Landing Page & Marketing Content:
* Action: Develop the initial marketing materials based on your content strategy.
* Details:
   * Landing Page: A simple one-page site that explains the service, has clear "Sign Up for Free" and "Go Pro" call-to-actions, and showcases the backtested performance.
   * Educational Content: Write the first few blog posts or create short videos on "Understanding Sports Arbitrage" and "How We Achieved a 55.95% ATS Record". This is your primary user acquisition tool.
3. Launch the Beta & Onboard First Users:
* Action: Invite a small group of beta testers to use the platform for free, as outlined in your launch plan.
* Details:
   * Follow the "Free User Journey" you designed for onboarding.
   * Set up a simple feedback collection mechanism (like a Discord server or a Google Form).
   * Use this initial feedback to fix bugs and refine the user experience before the public launch.
By focusing on these two sprints, you will have a live, functioning application capable of generating revenue and attracting your first users, moving your idea from a collection of documents into a tangible product.
